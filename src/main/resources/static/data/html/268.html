Information regarding the technologies we use</h2><p>When you use our Services, we and authorized third party providers make use of cookies and similar technologies (which we will refer to collectively as &quot;cookies&quot;). We make use of two main types of cookies: those which will not be saved on your device or which will only be saved on your device for as long as your browser is active (called session cookies); and those which will be saved on your device for a longer period (called persistent cookies). We take appropriate security measures to prevent unauthorized access to our cookies.</p><p>The cookies used in connection with the Services have various functions:</p><ul>	<li>They may be (technically) necessary for the provision of our Services</li>	<li>They help us to technically enhance our Services (e.g. monitoring of error messages and loading times)</li>	<li>They help us to recognize you so we can improve your user experience (e.g., by saving the font size and data entered into webforms)</li>	<li>They enable us to show you more relevant ads</li></ul><div class="expand_collapse_list"><h3 class="title">Learn more</h3><div class="hide"><div class="expand_collapse_list"><h3 class="title">1.1 What are cookies, web beacons and similar technologies?</h3><div class="hide"><p><strong>1.1.1 Cookies</strong><br />Cookies are small text files which are placed in the memory of your browser or device when you make use of our Services, in particular when you visit our websites or when you open a message. Cookies allow for a recognition of a specific device or browser. There are different types of cookies:</p><ul>	<li>Session cookies expire at the end of your session (e.g., when closing your browser window) and only allow tracking your activities during this session</li>	<li>Persistent cookies remain stored on your device between sessions and allow, for example, to track your settings or activities on several websites</li>	<li>First party cookies are set by the provider whose online service you are using (i.e., eBay)</li>	<li>Third party cookies are set by a provider other than the provider whose online service you are using (e.g., Adobe)</li></ul><p><strong>1.1.2 Web beacons</strong><br />Web beacons (also known as pixel tags or clear GIFs) are small graphic images that are used in connection with the provision of our Services and which typically work in conjunction with cookies to track the use of an online service by its users. For example, when we send you emails, web beacons allow us to track if you opened the emails and clicked links to measure campaign performance and improve features.</p><p><strong>1.1.3 Software Developer Kits</strong><br />Software Developer Kits (&quot;SDKs&quot;) are a collection of software development tools in one installable package, which allow third party developers to integrate with our mobile application for specific purposes (e.g., authentication). Some of the SDKs that eBay uses involve transferring data to your device.</p><p><strong>1.1.4 Similar technologies</strong><br />Similar technologies include local shared objects or local storage, such as flash cookies, HTML 5 cookies and other web application software methods, all of which store information in your browser or device to track your activity. Additionally, there are other technologies that function without local storage in your end device and instead make, for example, use of browser functions. In this context, a &quot;fingerprint&quot; of your system is created that serves as a unique identifier.</p><p>These technologies may function across all your browsers and in some cases are not fully managed by your browser, but may need to be managed directly from your installed applications or your device.</p></div></div><div class="expand_collapse_list"><h3 class="title">1.2 Why do we use these technologies?</h3><div class="hide"><p>Some of our Services can only be offered using cookies.

The use includes the Universal Analytics operating mode. This makes it possible to assign data, sessions and interactions across multiple devices to a pseudonymous user ID and thus analyze a user&#39;s activities across multiple devices. Google Analytics uses cookies that are stored on your device and that enable us to analyze your use of our Services. The data collected by the cookies regarding the use of our Services (including your IP address) are usually transferred to a Google server in the USA and stored there (see additional information on masked IP addresses below in this section).</p><p>On our behalf, Google processes this data to evaluate the use of our Services, to compile reports on usage activities and to provide us with further services associated with the use of our Services. Your IP address transmitted in the context of Google Analytics will not be combined with other data from Google.</p><p>The data collected via Google Analytics is automatically deleted after 14 months. Data whose retention period has been reached is automatically deleted once a month.</p><p>You can prevent the collection of data through the Google Analytics cookie by adjusting your browser settings accordingly. If you deactivate cookies, you may not be able to use all functions of our Services to their full extent, however. In addition, you can prevent the collection of data related to your use of the Services (including your IP address) via the Google Analytics cookie and the processing of this data by Google by installing the following <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout" target="_blank">browser plugin<span class="g-hdn"> - opens in new window or tab</span></a>.</p><p>Further information about Google Analytics can be found in the <a href="https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/analytics/terms/us/" target="_blank">terms of use<span class="g-hdn"> - opens in new window or tab</span></a> and in the <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">privacy policy<span class="g-hdn"> - opens in new window or tab</span></a> of Google.</p><p>We would like to point out that on our website, your IP address has been masked before sharing with Google Analytics. This means that, before your IP address is transmitted to Google&#39;s servers in the USA, it is sent to a Google server in the EEA, where it is shortened so that it cannot be traced to a specific person. Only after the IP address has been made anonymous is the shortened IP address sent to a Google server in the USA and stored there.</p><p><strong>2.2.2 Google Signals</strong><br />We also use Google Signals in connection with the provision of our Services. This is an extension function of Google Analytics that enables cross-device tracking. This means that if your Internet-enabled devices are linked to your Google Account, Google can generate reports on usage patterns (especially cross-device traffic) even if you switch devices. If you have activated the setting &quot;personalized ads&quot; in your Google account, Google will process data for this purpose. We do not process personal data in this respect, we only receive statistics based on Google Signals.</p><p>You can deactivate the use of Google Signals at any time by downloading and installing the browser plugin in order to opt-out of Google Analytics (see above under <a href="#Google Analytics">Google Analytics</a>). This will prevent the collection of data generated by the cookie and related to your use of the Services (including your IP address) and the processing of this data by Google. In addition, you can disable the &quot;personalized advertising&quot; setting in your Google Account.

For this purpose, reCAPTCHA analyzes the behavior of the user on the basis of various characteristics. This analysis automatically begins as soon as the user connects with the online service, e.g., visits the website. For the purposes of this analysis, reCAPTCHA evaluates various pieces of information (e.g., IP address, duration of the user&#39;s visit to the online service or the user&#39;s mouse movements). The data collected during the analysis is forwarded to Google. The analyses by reCAPTCHA are carried out entirely in the background.</p><p>Please find details regarding Google reCAPTCHA <a href="https://www.google.com/recaptcha/intro/v3.html" target="_blank">here<span class="g-hdn"> - opens in new window or tab</span></a> and in <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google&#39;s Privacy Notice<span class="g-hdn"> - opens in new window or tab</span></a>.</p></div></div></div></div><h2 id="section3">3.

(&quot;Google&quot;) to continuously improve our Services. The use includes the Universal Analytics operating mode. This makes it possible to assign data, sessions and interactions across multiple devices to a pseudonymous user ID and thus analyze a user&#39;s activities across multiple devices. Google Analytics uses cookies that are stored on your device and that enable us to analyze your use of our Services. The data collected by the cookies regarding the use of our Services (including your IP address) are usually transferred to a Google server in the USA and stored there (see additional information for users in the European Economic Area below in this section).</p><p>On our behalf, Google processes this data to evaluate the use of our Services, to compile reports on usage activities and to provide us with further services associated with the use of our Services. Your IP address transmitted in the context of Google Analytics will not be combined with other data from Google.</p><p>The data collected via Google Analytics is automatically deleted after 14 months. Data whose retention period has been reached is automatically deleted once a month.</p><p>You can prevent the collection of data through the Google Analytics cookie by adjusting your browser settings accordingly. If you deactivate cookies, you may not be able to use all functions of our Services to their full extent, however.</p><p>In addition, you can prevent the collection of data related to your use of the Services (including your IP address) via the Google Analytics cookie and the processing of this data by Google by installing the following <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout" target="_blank">browser plugin<span class="g-hdn"> - opens in new window or tab</span></a>.</p><p>Further information about Google Analytics can be found in the <a href="https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/analytics/terms/us/" target="_blank">terms of use<span class="g-hdn"> - opens in new window or tab</span></a> and in the <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">privacy policy<span class="g-hdn"> - opens in new window or tab</span></a> of Google.</p><p><strong>Additional information for users in the European Economic Area (EEA):</strong></p><p>We would like to point out that on our website Google Analytics has been extended by the code &quot;gat._anonymizeIp();&quot; in order to guarantee an anonymized collection of IP addresses (so-called IP masking). This means that, before your IP address is transmitted to Google&#39;s servers in the USA, it is sent to a Google server in the EU (or in another member state of the EEA), where it is shortened so that it cannot be traced to a specific person. Only after the IP address has been made anonymous is the shortened IP address sent to a Google server in the USA and stored there.</p></div></div><div class="expand_collapse_list"><h3 class="title">1.5&nbsp;Google Signals</h3><div class="hide"><p>We also use Google Signals in connection with the provision of our Services. This is an extension function of Google Analytics that enables cross-device tracking. This means that if your Internet-enabled devices are linked to your Google Account, Google can generate reports on usage patterns (especially cross-device traffic) even if you switch devices. If you have activated the setting &quot;personalized ads&quot; in your Google account, Google will process data for this purpose. We do not process personal data in this respect, we only receive statistics based on Google Signals.</p><p>You can deactivate the use of Google Signals at any time by downloading and installing the browser plugin in order to opt-out of Google Analytics (see above under <a href="#Google Analytics prev">Google Analytics</a>).

For this purpose, reCAPTCHA analyzes the behavior of the user on the basis of various characteristics. This analysis automatically begins as soon as the user connects with the online service, e.g. visits the website. For the purposes of this analysis, reCAPTCHA evaluates various pieces of information (e.g. IP address, duration of the user&#39;s visit to the online service or the user&#39;s mouse movements).

We make use of two main types of cookies: those which will not be saved on your device or which will only be saved on your device for as long as your browser is active (called session cookies); and those which will be saved on your device for a longer period (called persistent cookies). We take appropriate security measures to prevent unauthorized access to our cookies.\u003C/p>\n\n<p>The cookies used in connection with the Services have various functions:\u003C/p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>They may be (technically) necessary for the provision of our Services\u003C/li>\n\t<li>They help us to technically enhance our Services (e.g. monitoring of error messages and loading times)\u003C/li>\n\t<li>They help us to recognize you so we can improve your user experience (e.g., by saving the font size and data entered into webforms)\u003C/li>\n\t<li>They enable us to show you more relevant ads\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ul>\n\n<div class=\"expand_collapse_list\">\n<h3 class=\"title\">Learn more\u003C/h3>\n\n<div class=\"hide\">\n<div class=\"expand_collapse_list\">\n<h3 class=\"title\">1.1 What are cookies, web beacons and similar technologies?\u003C/h3>\n\n<div class=\"hide\">\n<p><strong>1.1.1 Cookies\u003C/strong><br />\nCookies are small text files which are placed in the memory of your browser or device when you make use of our Services, in particular when you visit our websites or when you open a message. Cookies allow for a recognition of a specific device or browser. There are different types of cookies:\u003C/p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Session cookies expire at the end of your session (e.g., when closing your browser window) and only allow tracking your activities during this session\u003C/li>\n\t<li>Persistent cookies remain stored on your device between sessions and allow, for example, to track your settings or activities on several websites\u003C/li>\n\t<li>First party cookies are set by the provider whose online service you are using (i.e., eBay)\u003C/li>\n\t<li>Third party cookies are set by a provider other than the provider whose online service you are using (e.g., Adobe)\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ul>\n\n<p><strong>1.1.2 Web beacons\u003C/strong><br />\nWeb beacons (also known as pixel tags or clear GIFs) are small graphic images that are used in connection with the provision of our Services and which typically work in conjunction with cookies to track the use of an online service by its users. For example, when we send you emails, web beacons allow us to track if you opened the emails and clicked links to measure campaign performance and improve features.\u003C/p>\n\n<p><strong>1.1.3 Software Developer Kits\u003C/strong><br />\nSoftware Developer Kits (&quot;SDKs&quot;) are a collection of software development tools in one installable package, which allow third party developers to integrate with our mobile application for specific purposes (e.g., authentication). Some of the SDKs that eBay uses involve transferring data to your device.\u003C/p>\n\n<p><strong>1.1.4 Similar technologies\u003C/strong><br />\nSimilar technologies include local shared objects or local storage, such as flash cookies, HTML 5 cookies and other web application software methods, all of which store information in your browser or device to track your activity. Additionally, there are other technologies that function without local storage in your end device and instead make, for example, use of browser functions. In this context, a &quot;fingerprint&quot; of your system is created that serves as a unique identifier.\u003C/p>\n\n<p>These technologies may function across all your browsers and in some cases are not fully managed by your browser, but may need to be managed directly from your installed applications or your device.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/div>\n\u003C/div>\n\n<div class=\"expand_collapse_list\">\n<h3 class=\"title\">1.2 Why do we use these technologies?\u003C/h3>\n\n<div class=\"hide\">\n<p>Some of our Services can only be offered using cookies.

The use includes the Universal Analytics operating mode. This makes it possible to assign data, sessions and interactions across multiple devices to a pseudonymous user ID and thus analyze a user&#39;s activities across multiple devices. Google Analytics uses cookies that are stored on your device and that enable us to analyze your use of our Services. The data collected by the cookies regarding the use of our Services (including your IP address) are usually transferred to a Google server in the USA and stored there (see additional information on masked IP addresses below in this section).\u003C/p>\n\n<p>On our behalf, Google processes this data to evaluate the use of our Services, to compile reports on usage activities and to provide us with further services associated with the use of our Services.

If you deactivate cookies, you may not be able to use all functions of our Services to their full extent, however. In addition, you can prevent the collection of data related to your use of the Services (including your IP address) via the Google Analytics cookie and the processing of this data by Google by installing the following <a href=\"https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout\" target=\"_blank\">browser plugin<span class=\"g-hdn\"> - opens in new window or tab\u003C/span>\u003C/a>.\u003C/p>\n\n<p>Further information about Google Analytics can be found in the <a href=\"https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/analytics/terms/us/\" target=\"_blank\">terms of use<span class=\"g-hdn\"> - opens in new window or tab\u003C/span>\u003C/a> and in the <a href=\"https://policies.google.com/privacy\" target=\"_blank\">privacy policy<span class=\"g-hdn\"> - opens in new window or tab\u003C/span>\u003C/a> of Google.\u003C/p>\n\n<p>We would like to point out that on our website, your IP address has been masked before sharing with Google Analytics. This means that, before your IP address is transmitted to Google&#39;s servers in the USA, it is sent to a Google server in the EEA, where it is shortened so that it cannot be traced to a specific person. Only after the IP address has been made anonymous is the shortened IP address sent to a Google server in the USA and stored there.\u003C/p>\n\n<p><strong>2.2.2 Google Signals\u003C/strong><br />\nWe also use Google Signals in connection with the provision of our Services. This is an extension function of Google Analytics that enables cross-device tracking. This means that if your Internet-enabled devices are linked to your Google Account, Google can generate reports on usage patterns (especially cross-device traffic) even if you switch devices. If you have activated the setting &quot;personalized ads&quot; in your Google account, Google will process data for this purpose. We do not process personal data in this respect, we only receive statistics based on Google Signals.\u003C/p>\n\n<p>You can deactivate the use of Google Signals at any time by downloading and installing the browser plugin in order to opt-out of Google Analytics (see above under <a href=\"#Google Analytics\">Google Analytics\u003C/a>). This will prevent the collection of data generated by the cookie and related to your use of the Services (including your IP address) and the processing of this data by Google.

(&quot;Google&quot;) to continuously improve our Services. The use includes the Universal Analytics operating mode. This makes it possible to assign data, sessions and interactions across multiple devices to a pseudonymous user ID and thus analyze a user&#39;s activities across multiple devices. Google Analytics uses cookies that are stored on your device and that enable us to analyze your use of our Services. The data collected by the cookies regarding the use of our Services (including your IP address) are usually transferred to a Google server in the USA and stored there (see additional information for users in the European Economic Area below in this section).\u003C/p>\n\n<p>On our behalf, Google processes this data to evaluate the use of our Services, to compile reports on usage activities and to provide us with further services associated with the use of our Services. Your IP address transmitted in the context of Google Analytics will not be combined with other data from Google.\u003C/p>\n\n<p>The data collected via Google Analytics is automatically deleted after 14 months. Data whose retention period has been reached is automatically deleted once a month.\u003C/p>\n\n<p>You can prevent the collection of data through the Google Analytics cookie by adjusting your browser settings accordingly. If you deactivate cookies, you may not be able to use all functions of our Services to their full extent, however.\u003C/p>\n\n<p>In addition, you can prevent the collection of data related to your use of the Services (including your IP address) via the Google Analytics cookie and the processing of this data by Google by installing the following <a href=\"https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout\" target=\"_blank\">browser plugin<span class=\"g-hdn\"> - opens in new window or tab\u003C/span>\u003C/a>.\u003C/p>\n\n<p>Further information about Google Analytics can be found in the <a href=\"https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/analytics/terms/us/\" target=\"_blank\">terms of use<span class=\"g-hdn\"> - opens in new window or tab\u003C/span>\u003C/a> and in the <a href=\"https://policies.google.com/privacy\" target=\"_blank\">privacy policy<span class=\"g-hdn\"> - opens in new window or tab\u003C/span>\u003C/a> of Google.\u003C/p>\n\n<p><strong>Additional information for users in the European Economic Area (EEA):\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\n\n<p>We would like to point out that on our website Google Analytics has been extended by the code &quot;gat._anonymizeIp();&quot; in order to guarantee an anonymized collection of IP addresses (so-called IP masking). This means that, before your IP address is transmitted to Google&#39;s servers in the USA, it is sent to a Google server in the EU (or in another member state of the EEA), where it is shortened so that it cannot be traced to a specific person. Only after the IP address has been made anonymous is the shortened IP address sent to a Google server in the USA and stored there.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/div>\n\u003C/div>\n\n<div class=\"expand_collapse_list\">\n<h3 class=\"title\">1.5&nbsp;Google Signals\u003C/h3>\n\n<div class=\"hide\">\n<p>We also use Google Signals in connection with the provision of our Services. This is an extension function of Google Analytics that enables cross-device tracking. This means that if your Internet-enabled devices are linked to your Google Account, Google can generate reports on usage patterns (especially cross-device traffic) even if you switch devices. If you have activated the setting &quot;personalized ads&quot; in your Google account, Google will process data for this purpose. We do not process personal data in this respect, we only receive statistics based on Google Signals.\u003C/p>\n\n<p>You can deactivate the use of Google Signals at any time by downloading and installing the browser plugin in order to opt-out of Google Analytics (see above under <a href=\"#Google Analytics prev\">Google Analytics\u003C/a>). This will prevent the collection of data generated by the cookie and related to your use of the Services (including your IP address) and the processing of this data by Google.

For the purposes of this analysis, reCAPTCHA evaluates various pieces of information (e.g. IP address, duration of the user&#39;s visit to the online service or the user&#39;s mouse movements).
