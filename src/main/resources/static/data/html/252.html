About eBay</h2><p>eBay is a marketplace that allows users to offer, sell and buy goods and services in various geographic locations using a variety of pricing formats. eBay is not a party to contracts for sale between third-party sellers and buyers, nor is eBay a traditional auctioneer.</p><p>Any guidance eBay provides as part of our Services, such as pricing, shipping, listing, and sourcing is solely informational and you may decide to follow it or not. We may help facilitate the resolution of disputes between buyers and sellers through various programs. Unless otherwise expressly provided, eBay has no control over and does not guarantee: the existence, quality, safety or legality of items advertised; the truth or accuracy of users&#39; content or listings; the ability of sellers to sell items; the ability of buyers to pay for items; or that a buyer or seller will actually complete a transaction or return an item.</p><h2><a id="3" name="3"></a>3. Using eBay</h2><p>In connection with using or accessing our Services you agree to comply with this User Agreement, our policies, our terms, and all applicable laws, rules, and regulations, and you will not:</p><ul>	<li>breach or circumvent any laws, regulations, third-party rights or our systems, Services, policies, or determinations of your account status;</li>	<li>use our Services if you are not able to form legally binding contracts (for example, if you are under 18 years old), or are temporarily or indefinitely suspended from using our Services, or are a person with whom transactions are prohibited under economic or trade sanctions;</li>	<li>fail to pay for items purchased by you, unless you have a valid reason as set out in an eBay policy, for example, the seller has materially changed the item&#39;s description after you bid (see our <a href="/help/policies/payment-policies/unpaid-item-policy?id=4271">Unpaid item policy</a>);</li>	<li>fail to deliver items sold by you, unless you have a valid reason as set out in an eBay policy;</li>	<li>manipulate the price of any item or interfere with any other user&#39;s listings;</li>	<li>take any action that may undermine the feedback or ratings systems (our <a href="/help/policies/feedback-policies/feedback-policies?id=4208">Feedback policies</a>);</li>	<li>transfer your eBay account (including feedback) and user ID to another party without our consent;</li>	<li>share your log in credentials with any third parties.

Policy Enforcement</h2><p>When a buyer or seller issue arises, we may consider the user&#39;s performance history and the specific circumstances in applying our policies. We may choose to be more lenient with policy enforcement in an effort to do the right thing for both buyers and sellers. The foregoing does not limit or impair our right to refuse, modify, or terminate all or part of our Services to anyone, or to terminate this agreement with anyone, for any reason at our discretion.</p><h2><a id="5" name="5"></a>5. Fees and Taxes</h2><p>We charge sellers for the use of our Services.

To drive the recommendations experience, you agree that we may display the sales and performance history of your individual listings to other sellers,</li>	<li>For items listed in certain categories, subject to certain programs, and/or offered or sold at certain price points, eBay may require the use of certain payment methods, subject to our <a href="/help/policies/payment-policies/accepted-payments-policy?id=4269">Payments methods policy</a>.

International Buying and Selling; Translation</h2><p>Given the nature of eBay&#39;s global marketplace, listings may be viewed and purchased by, and shipped to, buyers around the world. Many of our Services are accessible internationally. We offer certain programs, tools, and site experiences of particular interest to international sellers and buyers, such as estimated local currency conversion and international shipping calculation tools. Sellers and buyers are responsible for complying with all laws and regulations applicable to the international sale, purchase, and shipment of items.</p><p>If you purchase an item on an eBay site that is different from your registration site, you are subject to the User Agreement and applicable policies of that other eBay site with respect to that particular purchase, as detailed in the <a href="/help/policies/selling-policies/international-selling-policy?id=4689">International selling policy</a>.</p><p>For sellers, you agree that we may display your listing for sale on an eBay site other than the site where you listed your item for sale, based on your shipping settings. You may adjust these settings as detailed in the <a href="/help/policies/selling-policies/international-selling-policy?id=4689">International selling policy</a>. If you list your items with an international shipping option, the appearance of your listings on sites other than the listing site is not guaranteed. If you sell an item on an eBay site that is different from your registration or listing site, you are subject to the User Agreement and applicable policies, including any buyer protection programs, of that other eBay site with respect to that particular sale, as detailed in the <a href="/help/policies/selling-policies/international-selling-policy?id=4689" target="_blank">International selling policy</a>.</p><p>You authorize us to use automated tools to translate your eBay content and member-to-member communications, in whole or in part, into local languages where such translation solutions are available. We may provide you with tools which will enable you to translate content at your request. The accuracy and availability of any translation are not guaranteed.</p><p>One of the ways that we may make eBay.com listings available to international buyers on eBay.com and on eBay&#39;s international sites is through the <a href="/help/selling/shipping-items/setting-shipping-options/global-shipping-program?id=4646">Global Shipping Program</a>. For eligible items located in the United States and purchased by an international buyer through the Global Shipping Program, you (as seller) will simply ship the item to a parcel processing facility located in the United States after receiving notification of payment from the buyer. Pitney Bowes Inc., a third-party global shipping provider, will oversee the processing, customs clearance, and international shipment of the item on behalf of your international buyer. To the extent a buyer has a question about your Global Shipping Program listings, eBay may respond directly to the buyer if the question pertains to the services overseen by Pitney Bowes Inc. (for example, customs or international shipping). Sellers pay no additional fees for selling through the Global Shipping Program.</p><p>Pursuant to a routed export transaction under the U.S. Export Administration Regulations and Foreign Trade Regulations, the buyer, as the Foreign Principal Party in Interest, will agree to assume responsibility for the export shipment, with Pitney Bowes Inc. acting as your buyer&#39;s forwarding agent. You remain liable for the accuracy of information you provide about items, and you agree to provide timely responses to requests for additional information.</p><p>You consent to the disclosure of certain personally identifiable information, as well as listing and order information, by eBay to Pitney Bowes Inc., and by Pitney Bowes Inc. to its affiliates, service providers, and other third parties (such as customs and revenue authorities, as well as other government agencies), in connection with the processing, export and customs clearance, and international transportation of any item. eBay does not control the privacy policies of Pitney Bowes Inc., its affiliates, or its service providers, and you are subject to the privacy policies of those parties, as applicable.</p><p>Additional information about the program, including policies governing feedback, the handling of lost, damaged, and undeliverable items, returns, and the resolution of buyer protection claims for items that you sell through the program, can be found on our <a href="https://pages.ebay.com/seller-center/shipping/global-shipping.html" target="_blank">Global Shipping Program<span class="g-hdn"> - opens in new window or tab</span></a> and <a href="https://pages.ebay.com/seller-center/shipping/global-shipping-program.html#faqs" target="_blank">Global Shipping FAQs<span class="g-hdn"> - opens in new window or tab</span></a> pages.</p><h2><a id="9" name="9"></a>9.

All other claims will be arbitrated.</p>	</li>	<li><strong>Arbitration Procedures</strong>	<p>Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, and court review of an arbitration award is very limited. However, an arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individualized basis that a court can award to an individual. An arbitrator should apply the terms of the User Agreement as a court would. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except that issues relating to arbitrability, the scope or enforceability of this Agreement to Arbitrate, or the interpretation of Section 1 of this Agreement to Arbitrate (&quot;Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief&quot;), shall be for a court of competent jurisdiction to decide.</p>	<p>The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (&quot;AAA&quot;) under its rules and procedures, including the AAA&#39;s Consumer Arbitration Rules and the AAA&#39;s Commercial Arbitration Rules, and the AAA&#39;s International Centre for Dispute Resolution Rules (as applicable), as modified by this Agreement to Arbitrate. Absent agreement of the parties, the AAA shall decide which AAA rules apply to the arbitration. The AAA&#39;s rules are available at <a href="https://www.adr.org/" target="_blank">www.adr.org<span class="g-hdn"> - opens in new window or tab</span></a> and <a href="https://www.icdr.org" target="_blank">www.icdr.org<span class="g-hdn"> - opens in new window or tab</span></a>. In the event that the AAA is unavailable to administer the arbitration, another administrator will be selected by the parties or, if the parties cannot reach the agreement, the court (pursuant to Section 18.C below) shall select the administrator.</p>	<p>A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a valid Notice of Dispute (&quot;Notice&quot;), which may be downloaded at <a href="http://p.ebaystatic.com/aw/help/legal/Notice_of_Dispute.pdf" target="_blank">this link<span class="g-hdn"> - opens in new window or tab</span></a>. The Notice to eBay must be sent to eBay Inc., Attn: Litigation Department, Re: Notice of Dispute, 583 W. eBay Way, Draper, UT 84020. eBay will send any Notice to you to the physical address we have on file associated with your eBay account; it is your responsibility to keep your physical address up to date. To be valid, you must personally sign the Notice and complete all information on the Notice form, including a description of the nature and basis of the claims you are asserting, the specific relief sought, and the email address and phone number associated with your account.</p>	<p>If you and eBay are unable to resolve the claims described in a valid Notice within 30 days after eBay receives that Notice, you or eBay may initiate arbitration proceedings. A form for initiating arbitration proceedings is available on the AAA&#39;s site at www.adr.org. In addition to filing this form with the AAA in accordance with its rules and procedures, the party initiating the arbitration must mail a copy of the completed form to the opposing party. You may send a copy to eBay at the following address: eBay, Inc. c/o CT Corporation System, 1108 E South Union Ave., Midvale, UT 84047. In the event eBay initiates an arbitration against you, it will send a copy of the completed form to the physical address we have on file associated with your eBay account. Any settlement offer made by you or eBay shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator.</p>	<p>If you are a resident of the United States, then the arbitration hearing shall be held in the county in which you reside or at another mutually agreed location. If you are not a resident of the United States, then the arbitration hearing will be held in Salt Lake County, Utah, United States, or another mutually agreed location. Where no disclosed claims or counterclaims exceed $25,000, the dispute shall be resolved by the submission of documents only, subject to the arbitrator&#39;s discretion to require an in-person hearing, if the circumstances warrant. In cases where an in-person hearing is held, you and/or eBay may attend by telephone, unless the arbitrator requires otherwise. The language of the arbitration will be English.</p>	<p>The arbitrator will decide the substance of all claims in accordance with applicable law, including recognized principles of equity, and will honor all claims of privilege recognized by law. The arbitrator shall not be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving different users, but is bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving the same eBay user to the extent required by applicable law. The arbitrator&#39;s award shall be final and binding and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.</p>	</li>	<li><strong>Costs of Arbitration</strong>	<p>Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA&#39;s rules, unless otherwise stated in this Agreement to Arbitrate. If you complied with the Notice of Dispute procedures of Section 2 of this Agreement (&quot;Arbitration Procedures&quot;) and the value of the relief sought is $10,000 or less, at your request, eBay will pay all administration and arbitrator fees associated with the arbitration. Any request for payment of fees by eBay should be submitted by mail to the AAA along with your Demand for Arbitration and eBay will make arrangements to pay administration and arbitrator fees directly to the AAA. In the event the arbitrator determines the claim(s) you assert in the arbitration to be frivolous, you agree to reimburse eBay for all fees associated with the arbitration paid by eBay on your behalf that you otherwise would be obligated to pay under the AAA&#39;s rules.</p>	</li>	<li><strong>Severability</strong>	<p>With the exception of any of the provisions in Section 1 of this Agreement to Arbitrate (&quot;Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief&quot;), if an arbitrator or court decides that any part of this Agreement to Arbitrate is invalid or unenforceable, the other parts of this Agreement to Arbitrate shall still apply.</p>	</li>	<li><strong>Opt-Out Procedure</strong>	<p><strong>IF YOU ARE A NEW USER OF OUR SERVICES, YOU CAN CHOOSE TO REJECT THIS AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE (&quot;OPT-OUT&quot;) BY MAILING US A WRITTEN OPT-OUT NOTICE (&quot;OPT-OUT NOTICE&quot;).

About eBay</h2><p>eBay is a marketplace that allows users to offer, sell and buy just about anything in a variety of pricing formats and locations. The actual contract for sale is directly between the seller and buyer. eBay is not a party to the transaction, and it is not a seller or a traditional auctioneer.</p><p>Any guidance we provide as part of our Services, such as pricing, shipping, listing, and sourcing is solely informational and you may decide to follow it or not. Also, while we may help facilitate the resolution of disputes through various programs, eBay has no control over and does not guarantee: the existence, quality, safety or legality of items advertised; the truth or accuracy of users&#39; content or listings; the ability of sellers to sell items; the ability of buyers to pay for items; or that a buyer or seller will actually complete a transaction or return an item.</p><h2><a id="3." name="3."></a>3.

Failure to abide by third party terms and conditions may result in fees assessed to you (for example, currency conversion fees from your credit card issuer if the transaction currency is different from your credit card currency) or other actions taken by such third parties, and you agree that the payments entity has no control over, or responsibility or liability for, such fees or actions.</li></ul><h2><a id="15." name="15."></a>15.

All other claims will be arbitrated.</p>	</li>	<li><strong>Arbitration Procedures</strong>	<p>Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, and court review of an arbitration award is very limited. However, an arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individualized basis that a court can award to an individual. An arbitrator should apply the terms of the User Agreement as a court would. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except that issues relating to arbitrability, the scope or enforceability of this Agreement to Arbitrate, or the interpretation of Section 1 of this Agreement to Arbitrate (&quot;Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief&quot;), shall be for a court of competent jurisdiction to decide.</p>	<p>The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (&quot;AAA&quot;) under its rules and procedures, including the AAA&#39;s Consumer Arbitration Rules and the AAA&#39;s Commercial Arbitration Rules, and the AAA&#39;s International Centre for Dispute Resolution Rules (as applicable), as modified by this Agreement to Arbitrate. Absent agreement of the parties, the AAA shall decide which AAA rules apply to the arbitration. The AAA&#39;s rules are available at <a href="https://www.adr.org/" target="_blank">www.adr.org<span class="g-hdn"> - opens in new window or tab</span></a> and <a href="https://www.icdr.org" target="_blank">www.icdr.org<span class="g-hdn"> - opens in new window or tab</span></a>. In the event that the AAA is unavailable to administer the arbitration, another administrator will be selected by the parties or, if the parties cannot reach the agreement, the court (pursuant to Section 18.C below) shall select the administrator.</p>	<p>A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a valid Notice of Dispute (&quot;Notice&quot;), which may be downloaded at <a href="http://p.ebaystatic.com/aw/help/legal/Notice_of_Dispute.pdf" target="_blank">this link<span class="g-hdn"> - opens in new window or tab</span></a>. The Notice to eBay must be sent to eBay Inc., Attn: Litigation Department, Re: Notice of Dispute, 583 W. eBay Way, Draper, UT 84020. eBay will send any Notice to you to the physical address we have on file associated with your eBay account; it is your responsibility to keep your physical address up to date.

A form for initiating arbitration proceedings is available on the AAA&#39;s site at www.adr.org. In addition to filing this form with the AAA in accordance with its rules and procedures, the party initiating the arbitration must mail a copy of the completed form to the opposing party. You may send a copy to eBay at the following address: eBay, Inc. c/o CT Corporation System, 1108 E South Union Ave., Midvale, UT 84047.

Any settlement offer made by you or eBay shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator.</p>	<p>If you are a resident of the United States, then the arbitration hearing shall be held in the county in which you reside or at another mutually agreed location. If you are not a resident of the United States, then the arbitration hearing will be held in Salt Lake County, Utah, United States, or another mutually agreed location. Where no disclosed claims or counterclaims exceed $25,000, the dispute shall be resolved by the submission of documents only, subject to the arbitrator&#39;s discretion to require an in-person hearing, if the circumstances warrant. In cases where an in-person hearing is held, you and/or eBay may attend by telephone, unless the arbitrator requires otherwise. The language of the arbitration will be English.</p>	<p>The arbitrator will decide the substance of all claims in accordance with applicable law, including recognized principles of equity, and will honor all claims of privilege recognized by law. The arbitrator shall not be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving different users, but is bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving the same eBay user to the extent required by applicable law. The arbitrator&#39;s award shall be final and binding and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.</p>	</li>	<li><strong>Costs of Arbitration</strong>	<p>Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA&#39;s rules, unless otherwise stated in this Agreement to Arbitrate. If you complied with the Notice of Dispute procedures of Section 2 of this Agreement (&quot;Arbitration Procedures&quot;) and the value of the relief sought is $10,000 or less, at your request, eBay will pay all administration and arbitrator fees associated with the arbitration. Any request for payment of fees by eBay should be submitted by mail to the AAA along with your Demand for Arbitration and eBay will make arrangements to pay administration and arbitrator fees directly to the AAA. In the event the arbitrator determines the claim(s) you assert in the arbitration to be frivolous, you agree to reimburse eBay for all fees associated with the arbitration paid by eBay on your behalf that you otherwise would be obligated to pay under the AAA&#39;s rules.</p>	</li>	<li><strong>Severability</strong>	<p>With the exception of any of the provisions in Section 1 of this Agreement to Arbitrate (&quot;Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief&quot;), if an arbitrator or court decides that any part of this Agreement to Arbitrate is invalid or unenforceable, the other parts of this Agreement to Arbitrate shall still apply.</p>	</li>	<li><strong>Opt-Out Procedure</strong>	<p><strong>IF YOU ARE A NEW USER OF OUR SERVICES, YOU CAN CHOOSE TO REJECT THIS AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE (&quot;OPT-OUT&quot;) BY MAILING US A WRITTEN OPT-OUT NOTICE (&quot;OPT-OUT NOTICE&quot;).

Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, and court review of an arbitration award is very limited.

An arbitrator should apply the terms of the User Agreement as a court would. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except that issues relating to arbitrability, the scope or enforceability of this Agreement to Arbitrate, or the interpretation of Section 1 of this Agreement to Arbitrate (&quot;Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief&quot;), shall be for a court of competent jurisdiction to decide.\u003C/p>\n\n\t<p>The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (&quot;AAA&quot;) under its rules and procedures, including the AAA&#39;s Consumer Arbitration Rules and the AAA&#39;s Commercial Arbitration Rules, and the AAA&#39;s International Centre for Dispute Resolution Rules (as applicable), as modified by this Agreement to Arbitrate. Absent agreement of the parties, the AAA shall decide which AAA rules apply to the arbitration.

The Notice to eBay must be sent to eBay Inc., Attn: Litigation Department, Re: Notice of Dispute, 583 W. eBay Way, Draper, UT 84020. eBay will send any Notice to you to the physical address we have on file associated with your eBay account; it is your responsibility to keep your physical address up to date.

A form for initiating arbitration proceedings is available on the AAA&#39;s site at www.adr.org. In addition to filing this form with the AAA in accordance with its rules and procedures, the party initiating the arbitration must mail a copy of the completed form to the opposing party. You may send a copy to eBay at the following address: eBay, Inc. c/o CT Corporation System, 1108 E South Union Ave., Midvale, UT 84047.

Where no disclosed claims or counterclaims exceed $25,000, the dispute shall be resolved by the submission of documents only, subject to the arbitrator&#39;s discretion to require an in-person hearing, if the circumstances warrant. In cases where an in-person hearing is held, you and/or eBay may attend by telephone, unless the arbitrator requires otherwise. The language of the arbitration will be English.\u003C/p>\n\n\t<p>The arbitrator will decide the substance of all claims in accordance with applicable law, including recognized principles of equity, and will honor all claims of privilege recognized by law. The arbitrator shall not be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving different users, but is bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving the same eBay user to the extent required by applicable law.
