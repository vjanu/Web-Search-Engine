What is eBay’s price guarantee? eBay’s price guarantee helps you get top dollar for your items while keeping your price competitive.

Here’s how it works: Start a listing for your item and eBay will automatically determine if it qualifies for the eBay price guarantee. You’ll see its market range based on similar items sold on eBay within the last 90 days. If it qualifies, follow our pricing guidance and list your item for sale. There will be a guaranteed pricing option when creating a new listing. If it sells for less, you’ll receive an eBay coupon for the difference.
