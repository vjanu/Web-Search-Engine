Page navigation Home Selling Customer service tips Customer service tips One of the most effective ways to ensure that your customers keep coming back is to give them a satisfactory buying experience. Here are some tips to get you started. 1. Let buyers know when their purchase will arrive Being informed about the status of their order is one of the most important aspects of a buyers’ online shopping experience. Informed buyers are also less likely to make an “item not received” claim. Keep your buyers happy by: Setting accurate handling times. The handling time you set for each listing is a commitment to buyers to get orders to your shipping carrier on time. It’s important to stick to your handling time and to set handling times you know you can make. You may wish to adjust your handling time during busy seasons or popular promotions. Uploading tracking information. You are required to upload integrated tracking in the structured data field before the estimated delivery date has passed in order to appeal an “item not received” claim. eBay will not protect you from a claim if you send the tracking number to the buyer via email. Without tracking information, eBay can’t protect you because we won’t be able to confirm your item was delivered. eBay labels uploads tracking automatically. Some shipping services don’t add or integrate tracking at all, and manually uploading tracking can lead to errors. 2. Offer a generous returns policy Shoppers are more likely to buy an item when they’re confident that it can be returned if necessary. That’s why offering a generous return policy makes good business sense. Learn how a strong policy can give you an edge over other sellers. It’s easier than you might think and well worth the effort. For example, you can now automatically approve certain kinds of returns or issue refunds. That way you can keep business moving without interruption. 3. Create clear and accurate listings Write a clear description and include well-shot photos, that way your buyers have a good idea about what they’re ordering. If your buyer knows what to expect from their order, they’re less likely to be dissatisfied when they receive it. Learn to create listings that sell and satisfy customers. 4. Avoid unpaid items If you don’t already, you should require immediate payment for both fixed-price and auction-style listings with a Buy It Now option. Resolving payments immediately helps to avoid possible disputes with your buyer down the road. Learn more about resolving unpaid items, including how to automatically cancel an order if a buyer doesn’t pay within the allotted time. 5. Manage your buyers’ requests and disputes You can view your buyers’ refunds, returns, “Item not received” and “Item not as described” requests, and payment disputes in the Orders tab on Seller Hub or in My eBay. Keeping on top of these requests and disputes helps keep your buyers satisfied, increasing the chances that they’ll become return customers.
