We will only transfer your personal data from the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom or Switzerland to third countries, i.e. countries outside the EEA, on the basis of appropriate safeguards or if otherwise authorized by applicable law. Third countries providing an adequate level of data protection according to the European Commission currently include Andorra, Argentina, Canada (for companies covered by the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act), Switzerland (for transfers out of the EEA), the Faroe Islands, Guernsey, the State of Israel, the Isle of Man, Japan, Jersey, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and Uruguay. In other cases, eBay provides the necessary safeguards, e.g. through the conclusion of data protection contracts adopted by the European Commission (e.g. standard data protection clauses (2021/914/EU, 2010/87/EU, 2001/497/EC or 2004/915/EC)) with the recipients, or through other measures provided for by law. A copy of the documentation of the measures taken by us is available <a href="#section3">on request</a>. We regularly reevaluate the measures taken to assess requirements deriving from new regulatory guidance and case law, e.g. from the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) decision in the matter C-311/18.</p></div><div class="line">&nbsp;</div><img alt="" src="https://secureir.ebaystatic.com/pictures/aw/OCS_SelfService/Icon_ebay_UPN_DataRetentionDeletion_FullColor.svg" style="float:left" /><h2 id="section7" style="display: inline-block;">7. &nbsp;Storage duration and erasure</h2>&nbsp;<p>Your personal data will be stored by us and our service providers in accordance with applicable data protection laws to the extent necessary for the processing purposes set out in this User Privacy Notice (see section <a href="#section5">5.

Subsequently, we will delete your personal data in accordance with our data retention and deletion policy or take steps to properly render the data anonymous, unless we are legally obliged or permitted to keep your personal data longer (e.g. for legal compliance, tax, accounting or auditing purposes, or to detect and prevent fraudulent or illegal activity on eBay). In Europe, the retention periods are generally between 6 and 10 years (e.g. for contracts, notifications and business letters). As far as legally permissible or required, we restrict the processing of your data instead of deleting it (e.g. by restricting access to it). This applies in particular to cases where we may still need the data for the execution of the contract or for the assertion of or defense against legal claims, or where such retention is otherwise required or permitted by law. In these cases, the duration of the restriction of processing depends on the respective statutory limitation or retention periods. The data will be deleted after the relevant limitation or retention periods have expired.</p><div class="expand_collapse_list"><h3 class="title">Learn more about section 7</h3><div class="hide"><p>The specific retention periods for personal data are documented in our regional data retention guidelines. How long we retain personal data may vary depending on the Services we provide and our legal obligations under applicable national law. The following factors typically affect the retention period:</p><ul>	<li><strong>Necessity for the provision of our Services</strong><br />	This includes such things as executing the User Agreement with you, maintaining and improving the performance of our products, keeping our systems secure, and maintaining appropriate business and financial records.

However, when users are involved in a transaction, they have access to each other&#39;s name, user ID, (alias) email address and other contact and shipping information.&nbsp;For example, we may allow users to exchange telephone numbers in order to contact each other prior to completing a transaction (e.g. a seller may opt to share their telephone number with a buyer so that the buyer may call with questions about a listed item).

Through our Binding Corporate Rules, the eBay Inc. corporate family members undertake to protect your personal data and to comply with data protection obligations.

Third countries providing an adequate level of data protection according to the European Commission currently include Andorra, Argentina, Canada (for companies covered by the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act), Switzerland, the Faroe Islands, Guernsey, the State of Israel, the Isle of Man, Japan, Jersey, New Zealand and Uruguay.&nbsp;In other cases, eBay provides the necessary safeguards, e.g. through the conclusion of data protection contracts adopted by the European Commission (e.g. standard data protection clauses (2010/87/EU, 2001/497/EC or 2004/915/EC)) with the recipients, or through other measures provided for by law.

Subsequently, we will delete your personal data in accordance with our data retention and deletion policy or take steps to properly render the data anonymous, unless we are legally obliged to keep your personal data longer (e.g. for legal compliance, tax, accounting or auditing purposes). In Europe, the retention periods are generally between 6 and 10 years (e.g. for contracts, notifications and business letters). As far as legally permissible or required, we restrict the processing of your data instead of deleting it (e.g. by restricting access to it). This applies in particular to cases where we may still need the data for the execution of the contract or for the assertion of or defense against legal claims, or where such retention is otherwise required or permitted by law. In these cases, the duration of the restriction of processing depends on the respective statutory limitation or retention periods. The data will be deleted after the relevant limitation or retention periods have expired.</p><div class="expand_collapse_list"><h3 class="title">Learn more about section 7</h3><div class="hide"><p>The specific retention periods for personal data are documented in our regional data retention guidelines. How long we retain personal data may vary depending on the Services we provide and our legal obligations under applicable national law. The following factors typically affect the retention period:</p><ul>	<li><strong>Necessity for the provision of our Services</strong><br />	This includes such things as executing the User Agreement with you, maintaining and improving the performance of our products, keeping our systems secure, and maintaining appropriate business and financial records. Most of our retention periods are determined on the basis of this general rule.</li>	<li><strong>Special categories of personal data</strong><br />	If we store special categories of personal data (i.e., personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, genetic or biometric data which is being processed for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person, data concerning health or data concerning a natural person&#39;s sex life or sexual orientation), a shorter retention period is usually appropriate.</li>	<li><strong>Consent-based processing of personal data</strong><br />	If we process personal data on the basis of consent (including consent to the extended storage), we store the data for as long as necessary in order to process it according to your consent.</li>	<li><strong>Statutory, contractual or other similar obligations</strong><br />	Corresponding storage obligations may arise, for example, from laws or official orders.

For example, other users can see your bids, purchases, items for sale, saved interests, sellers and searches, storefronts, feedback, ratings, product reviews and associated comments. Other users can also see any information you chose to share in your profile.</p><p>When you use our Services, your public user ID may be displayed and available to the public and associated with all of your public eBay activity. Notices sent to other users about suspicious activity and notice violations on our sites may refer to your public user ID and specific items. Accordingly, if you use a username that allows others to identify you, these others may be able to identify your eBay activities.</p><p>To help protect your personal data, we allow only limited access to other users&#39; contact, shipping and financial information as necessary to facilitate your transactions and collect payments. However, when users are involved in a transaction, they have access to each other&#39;s name, user ID, email address and other contact and shipping information.&nbsp;For example, we may allow users to exchange telephone numbers in order to contact each other prior to completing a transaction (e.g. a seller may opt to share their telephone number with a buyer so that the buyer may call with questions about a listed item). In this case, sellers are prohibited from using a buyer&#39;s telephone number for other purposes (e.g. completing a transaction off eBay or adding the buyer to a marketing list).</p><h3>Your responsibilities over transactional information you receive through eBay</h3><p>When you complete a transaction with another user (or a transaction has been cancelled, failed, or subsequently invalidated), we will provide you with the other user&#39;s personal data (such as name, username, email address, contact information, shipping and billing information, or return address). Independent from us, you are the controller of such data and responsible for any processing that you perform after we have shared this data with you, including compliance with any limitations imposed by this User Privacy Notice and our User Agreement.</p><p>Unless you act for purely personal purposes, we recommend that you explain your data processing activities in your own privacy notice and protect the privacy of other users. As a seller, you must in any case comply with the applicable data protection laws and in particular protect the rights of other users as data subjects, e.g. give them the opportunity to access the personal data collected by you and demand that it be erased.</p><p>You may only use the personal data that you have access to for eBay transaction-related purposes, or for other Services offered through eBay (such as shipping, fraud complaints, and member-to-member communications), and for purposes expressly consented by the user to whom the data relates. Using personal data of other users that you have access to for any other purpose, such as adding them to a mailing list without their express consent, constitutes a violation of our <a href="/help/policies/member-behavior-policies/user-agreement?id=4259">User Agreement</a>.</p><h3>Personal data relating to third parties</h3><p>If you provide us with personal data relating to another person, you must obtain the consent of this person or the disclosure of the data to us must be otherwise legally permissible.

For example, under the Payments Terms of Use you must provide us with certain identification information including legal name, date of birth, and tax identification number or social security number so that we may fulfil our legal &quot;Know Your Customer&quot; (KYC) obligations. As described elsewhere in our User Privacy Notice and in the Payments Terms of Use, we may share this data with other eBay group companies in order to facilitate transactions and with service providers, including payment processors, credit agencies and bureaus. Although the provision of any other personal data (e.g. address and shipping data) is voluntary, it may be necessary for the use of our Services, such as bidding, purchase and sales data to complete a transaction.</p><h3>Children&#39;s Privacy</h3><p>Our services are not intended for the use by children.

Purposes and legal basis for data processing and categories of recipients\u003C/a>) who may be located anywhere in the world. We will only transfer your personal data from the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom or Switzerland to third countries, i.e. countries outside the EEA, on the basis of appropriate safeguards or if otherwise authorized by applicable law. Third countries providing an adequate level of data protection according to the European Commission currently include Andorra, Argentina, Canada (for companies covered by the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act), Switzerland (for transfers out of the EEA), the Faroe Islands, Guernsey, the State of Israel, the Isle of Man, Japan, Jersey, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and Uruguay. In other cases, eBay provides the necessary safeguards, e.g. through the conclusion of data protection contracts adopted by the European Commission (e.g. standard data protection clauses (2021/914/EU, 2010/87/EU, 2001/497/EC or 2004/915/EC)) with the recipients, or through other measures provided for by law. A copy of the documentation of the measures taken by us is available <a href=\"#section3\">on request\u003C/a>. We regularly reevaluate the measures taken to assess requirements deriving from new regulatory guidance and case law, e.g. from the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) decision in the matter C-311/18.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/div>\n\n<div class=\"line\">&nbsp;\u003C/div>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secureir.ebaystatic.com/pictures/aw/OCS_SelfService/Icon_ebay_UPN_DataRetentionDeletion_FullColor.svg\" style=\"float:left\" />\n<h2 id=\"section7\" style=\"display: inline-block;\">7. &nbsp;Storage duration and erasure\u003C/h2>\n&nbsp;\n\n<p>Your personal data will be stored by us and our service providers in accordance with applicable data protection laws to the extent necessary for the processing purposes set out in this User Privacy Notice (see section <a href=\"#section5\">5.

In Europe, the retention periods are generally between 6 and 10 years (e.g. for contracts, notifications and business letters). As far as legally permissible or required, we restrict the processing of your data instead of deleting it (e.g. by restricting access to it). This applies in particular to cases where we may still need the data for the execution of the contract or for the assertion of or defense against legal claims, or where such retention is otherwise required or permitted by law. In these cases, the duration of the restriction of processing depends on the respective statutory limitation or retention periods.

Accordingly, if you use a username that allows others to identify you, these others may be able to identify your eBay activities.\u003C/p>\n\n<p>To help protect your personal data, we allow only limited access to other users&#39; contact, shipping and financial information as necessary to facilitate your transactions and collect payments. However, when users are involved in a transaction, they have access to each other&#39;s name, user ID, (alias) email address and other contact and shipping information.&nbsp;For example, we may allow users to exchange telephone numbers in order to contact each other prior to completing a transaction (e.g. a seller may opt to share their telephone number with a buyer so that the buyer may call with questions about a listed item). In this case, sellers are prohibited from using a buyer&#39;s telephone number for other purposes (e.g. completing a transaction off eBay or adding the buyer to a marketing list).\u003C/p>\n\n<h3>Your responsibilities over transactional information you receive through eBay\u003C/h3>\n\n<p>When you complete a transaction with another user (or a transaction has been cancelled, failed, or subsequently invalidated), we will provide you with the other user&#39;s personal data (such as name, username, (alias) email address, contact information, shipping and billing information, or return address). Independent from us, you are the controller of such data and responsible for any processing that you perform after we have shared this data with you, including compliance with any limitations imposed by this User Privacy Notice and our User Agreement.\u003C/p>\n\n<p>Unless you act for purely personal purposes, we recommend that you explain your data processing activities in your own privacy notice and protect the privacy of other users. As a seller, you must in any case comply with the applicable data protection laws and in particular protect the rights of other users as data subjects, e.g. give them the opportunity to access the personal data collected by you and demand that it be erased.\u003C/p>\n\n<p>You may only use the personal data that you have access to for eBay transaction-related purposes, or for other Services offered through eBay (such as shipping, fraud complaints, and member-to-member communications), and for purposes expressly consented by the user to whom the data relates. Using personal data of other users that you have access to for any other purpose, such as adding them to a mailing list without their express consent, constitutes a violation of our <a href=\"/help/policies/member-behavior-policies/user-agreement?id=4259\">User Agreement\u003C/a>.\u003C/p>\n\n<h3>Personal data relating to third parties\u003C/h3>\n\n<p>If you provide us with personal data relating to another person, you must obtain the consent of this person or the disclosure of the data to us must be otherwise legally permissible. You must inform the other person of how we process personal data in accordance with our User Privacy Notice.\u003C/p>\n\n<h3>Filtering of messages sent via our messaging tools\u003C/h3>\n\n<p>All messages sent via our messaging tools (including chat messages and emails sent to eBay alias email addresses) are first received by us and then forwarded to the recipient. All messages are automatically filtered according to certain criteria. If necessary, conspicuous messages are checked manually by our customer service. In the event of a violation of our <a href=\"/help/policies/member-behavior-policies/user-agreement?id=4259\" target=\"_blank\">User Agreement\u003C/a> (including any of our <a href=\"/help/policies/default/ebay-rules-policies?id=4205\" target=\"_blank\">rules and policies\u003C/a>), we reserve the right to block the transmission of the message and to restrict the purchase and sales functions of your eBay account or to block your eBay account.\u003C/p>\n\n<p>This is to protect our legitimate interests such as protecting against fraudulent or suspicious activities (e.g. spam, viruses, phishing, or other illegal activities) or enforcing our <a href=\"/help/policies/member-behavior-policies/user-agreement?id=4259\">User Agreement\u003C/a> and our other <a href=\"/help/policies/default/ebay-rules-policies?id=4205\">rules and policies\u003C/a> (e.g. illegal and other prohibited content), including but not limited to enforcing the <a href=\"/help/policies/payment-policies/offers-buy-sell-outside-ebay-policy?id=4272\">prohibition of purchases and sales outside of eBay\u003C/a>.\u003C/p>\n\n<h3>Are you obliged to provide your personal data to us?\u003C/h3>\n\n<p>Some of the personal data that you provide to us (e.g. data by which we can identify you) are required to enter into the User Agreement and the Payments Terms of Use. For example, under the Payments Terms of Use you must provide us with certain identification information including legal name, date of birth, and tax identification number or social security number so that we may fulfil our legal &quot;Know Your Customer&quot; (KYC) obligations. As described elsewhere in our User Privacy Notice and in the Payments Terms of Use, we may share this data with other eBay group companies in order to facilitate transactions and with service providers, including payment processors, credit agencies and bureaus. Although the provision of any other personal data (e.g. address and shipping data) is voluntary, it may be necessary for the use of our Services, such as bidding, purchase and sales data to complete a transaction.\u003C/p>\n\n<h3>Children&#39;s Privacy\u003C/h3>\n\n<p>Our services are not intended for the use by children. We do not knowingly collect personal data from users who are considered children under applicable national laws. Under&nbsp;our User Agreement, children are not permitted to use our Services.\u003C/p>\n\n<h3>Staying Signed in\u003C/h3>\n\n<p>When you sign in to your account on our Services, we give you the option to stay signed in to your account for certain amount of time. If you are using a public or shared computer, we encourage you to decline. You or any other user of the computer/browser you signed in on will be able to view and access most parts of your account and take certain specific actions during this signed in period without any further authorization.

For example, other users can see your bids, purchases, items for sale, saved interests, sellers and searches, storefronts, feedback, ratings, product reviews and associated comments. Other users can also see any information you chose to share in your profile.\u003C/p>\n\n<p>When you use our Services, your public user ID may be displayed and available to the public and associated with all of your public eBay activity. Notices sent to other users about suspicious activity and notice violations on our sites may refer to your public user ID and specific items. Accordingly, if you use a username that allows others to identify you, these others may be able to identify your eBay activities.\u003C/p>\n\n<p>To help protect your personal data, we allow only limited access to other users&#39; contact, shipping and financial information as necessary to facilitate your transactions and collect payments. However, when users are involved in a transaction, they have access to each other&#39;s name, user ID, email address and other contact and shipping information.&nbsp;For example, we may allow users to exchange telephone numbers in order to contact each other prior to completing a transaction (e.g. a seller may opt to share their telephone number with a buyer so that the buyer may call with questions about a listed item). In this case, sellers are prohibited from using a buyer&#39;s telephone number for other purposes (e.g. completing a transaction off eBay or adding the buyer to a marketing list).\u003C/p>\n\n<h3>Your responsibilities over transactional information you receive through eBay\u003C/h3>\n\n<p>When you complete a transaction with another user (or a transaction has been cancelled, failed, or subsequently invalidated), we will provide you with the other user&#39;s personal data (such as name, username, email address, contact information, shipping and billing information, or return address). Independent from us, you are the controller of such data and responsible for any processing that you perform after we have shared this data with you, including compliance with any limitations imposed by this User Privacy Notice and our User Agreement.\u003C/p>\n\n<p>Unless you act for purely personal purposes, we recommend that you explain your data processing activities in your own privacy notice and protect the privacy of other users. As a seller, you must in any case comply with the applicable data protection laws and in particular protect the rights of other users as data subjects, e.g. give them the opportunity to access the personal data collected by you and demand that it be erased.\u003C/p>\n\n<p>You may only use the personal data that you have access to for eBay transaction-related purposes, or for other Services offered through eBay (such as shipping, fraud complaints, and member-to-member communications), and for purposes expressly consented by the user to whom the data relates. Using personal data of other users that you have access to for any other purpose, such as adding them to a mailing list without their express consent, constitutes a violation of our <a href=\"/help/policies/member-behavior-policies/user-agreement?id=4259\">User Agreement\u003C/a>.\u003C/p>\n\n<h3>Personal data relating to third parties\u003C/h3>\n\n<p>If you provide us with personal data relating to another person, you must obtain the consent of this person or the disclosure of the data to us must be otherwise legally permissible. You must inform the other person of how we process personal data in accordance with our User Privacy Notice.\u003C/p>\n\n<h3>Filtering of messages sent via our messaging tools\u003C/h3>\n\n<p>All messages sent via our messaging tools are first received by us and then forwarded to the recipient. All messages are automatically filtered according to certain criteria. If necessary, conspicuous messages are checked manually by our customer service. In the event of a violation of our <a href=\"/help/policies/member-behavior-policies/user-agreement?id=4259\" target=\"_blank\">User Agreement\u003C/a> (including any of our <a href=\"/help/policies/default/ebay-rules-policies?id=4205\" target=\"_blank\">rules and policies\u003C/a>), we reserve the right to block the transmission of the message and to restrict the purchase and sales functions of your eBay account or to block your eBay account.\u003C/p>\n\n<p>This is to protect our legitimate interests such as protecting against fraudulent or suspicious activities (e.g. spam, viruses, phishing, or other illegal activities) or enforcing our <a href=\"/help/policies/member-behavior-policies/user-agreement?id=4259\">User Agreement\u003C/a> and our other <a href=\"/help/policies/default/ebay-rules-policies?id=4205\">rules and policies\u003C/a> (e.g. illegal and other prohibited content), including but not limited to enforcing the <a href=\"/help/policies/payment-policies/offers-buy-sell-outside-ebay-policy?id=4272\">prohibition of purchases and sales outside of eBay\u003C/a>.\u003C/p>\n\n<h3>Are you obliged to provide your personal data to us?\u003C/h3>\n\n<p>Some of the personal data that you provide to us (e.g. data by which we can identify you) are required to enter into the User Agreement and the Payments Terms of Use. For example, under the Payments Terms of Use you must provide us with certain identification information including legal name, date of birth, and tax identification number or social security number so that we may fulfil our legal &quot;Know Your Customer&quot; (KYC) obligations. As described elsewhere in our User Privacy Notice and in the Payments Terms of Use, we may share this data with other eBay group companies in order to facilitate transactions and with service providers, including payment processors, credit agencies and bureaus. Although the provision of any other personal data (e.g. address and shipping data) is voluntary, it may be necessary for the use of our Services, such as bidding, purchase and sales data to complete a transaction.\u003C/p>\n\n<h3>Children&#39;s Privacy\u003C/h3>\n\n<p>Our services are not intended for the use by children. We do not knowingly collect personal data from users who are considered children under applicable national laws. Under&nbsp;our User Agreement, children are not permitted to use our Services.\u003C/p>\n\n<h3>Staying Signed in\u003C/h3>\n\n<p>When you sign in to your account on our Services, we give you the option to stay signed in to your account for certain amount of time. If you are using a public or shared computer, we encourage you to decline. You or any other user of the computer/browser you signed in on will be able to view and access most parts of your account and take certain specific actions during this signed in period without any further authorization.
