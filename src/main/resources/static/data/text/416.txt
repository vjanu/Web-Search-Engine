Insertion fees Final value fees Basic fees for most categories Fees for Real Estate listings Fees for optional listing upgrades Additional final value fees Dispute fee International fee Seller currency conversion charge Examples of fee calculations Other terms and conditions We charge two main types of selling fees: an insertion fee when you create a listing, and a final value fee when your item sells. Effective September 12, 2022, we're changing final value fees for listings in most Jewelry & Watches categories (excluding Watches, Parts & Accessories). Learn more about the upcoming changes - opens in new window or tab. The amount we charge depends on the item's price, the format and category you choose for your listing, any optional listing upgrades you add, and your seller conduct and performance. Do you have an eBay Store or want to sell vehicles? Fees are different for Store subscribers and for selling vehicles. See our pages below for more information: Store selling fees Fees for selling a vehicle on eBay Motors Insertion fees Every month, you get up to 250 zero insertion fee listings, or more if you have an eBay Store. Learn more about how zero insertion fee listings work, including the terms and exclusions for those listings. After you've used your zero insertion fee allowance, insertion fees are: Non-refundable if your item doesn't sell Charged per listing and per category. So, if you list your item in two categories, you'll pay an insertion fee for the second category too Charged for the original listing and each time you choose to relist your item Charged per listing if you create duplicate auction-style listings for identical items. Read more about our Duplicate listings policy Charged only once per listing for listings with multiple items. Read more about listings with multiple items and listings with variations Good 'Til Cancelled listings Good 'Til Cancelled listings are fixed price listings that renew automatically once per calendar month. We charge an insertion fee and applicable optional listing upgrade fees when you list your item for the first time, and each time it renews. These listings count towards your monthly zero insertion fee listings. Fee amounts are based on the terms in effect when the listing goes live and when it renews. Final value fees We charge one final value fee when your item sells, and you don't have to worry about third-party payment processing fees. This fee is calculated as a percentage of the total amount of the sale, plus $0.30 per order. The total amount of the sale includes the item price, any handling charges, the shipping service the buyer selects, sales tax, and any other applicable fees. If you offer 1-day or international shipping as well as a cheaper or free option (like domestic shipping), the total amount of the sale is calculated based on the cheapest domestic option you offer. If you only offer 1-day or international shipping but no cheaper option like domestic shipping, the total amount of the sale is calculated based on the service the buyer chooses. If you're in China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Israel, Japan, Macau, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, or Vietnam and your item isn't located in the US, the total amount of the sale is always calculated based on the shipping option your buyer chooses. An order is defined as any number of items purchased by the same buyer at checkout with the same shipping method. If you need to refund the buyer or cancel the sale, you may be eligible for fee credits as per our fee credits policy. Basic fees for most categories In the table below, you'll find the basic fees for items listed in most categories and the number of zero insertion fee listings you'll get each month.

Additional final value fees You may be charged final value fees if you violate our policy of buying or selling outside of eBay, or we may apply additional final value fees if you are not meeting our performance expectations. Buying or selling outside of eBay If you offer or reference your contact information or ask a buyer for their contact information in the context of buying or selling outside of eBay, you'll be charged a final value fee based on the total amount of the sale even if your item doesn't sell. In this situation, the total amount of the sale is determined as follows: Auction-style listing format: The total amount of the sale is the auction start price, the Buy It Now price (if applicable), the reserve price (if applicable), or the price identified between the buyer and seller, whichever is highest. Fixed price listing format: The total amount of the sale is the fixed price or the price identified between the buyer and seller, whichever is higher. Sellers not meeting performance expectations Additional final value fees may apply on sales in the following circumstances: If your account doesn't meet our minimum seller performance standards for the US in the evaluation on the 20th of the month, you'll be charged an additional 6% on the final value fees applicable to sales in the following calendar month. Go to your Seller Dashboard - opens in new window or tab to check your current seller level. This fee does not apply to Above Standard and eBay Top-rated Sellers If your rate of 'Item not as described' return requests is evaluated in your service metrics as Very High in the evaluation on the 20th of the month in one or more categories, you will be charged an additional 5% on the final value fees for sales in those categories in the following calendar month. You can view your personalized service metrics on your Service Metrics dashboard - opens in new window or tab in Seller Hub. Any additional final value fees will be calculated as a percentage of the total amount of the sale. We'll indicate which listings are subject to additional fees on your Account Summary - opens in new window or tab. Note: If your account isn't meeting our minimum seller performance standards and you're rated Very High in your rate of 'Item not as described' return requests, you'll only be charged the additional final value fee for not meeting our minimum seller performance standards. Dispute fee If you are found responsible for a disputed amount as per eBay policies (e.g., chargeback), we charge a $20.00 dispute fee, excluding sales tax, for each dispute. International fee If your registered address is in the US, we charge an International fee if either: The delivery address for the item (entered by the buyer during checkout) is outside the US, or The buyer's registered address is outside the US (regardless of the delivery address for the item) This fee is calculated as 1.65% of the total amount of the sale and is automatically deducted from your sales. If your registered address is not in the US, please refer to the fee page for your country or region of residence for your International fee information. Seller currency conversion charge When you create listings or sell items on an international eBay site, eBay may convert your funds to a different currency in order to collect amounts owed by you to eBay, or to payout funds due to you. For example, if your registered address is in the US and you create a listing on eBay.de for which fees are due (such as insertion and/or optional listing upgrade fees), eBay will convert your funds from USD to EUR using the transaction exchange rate applicable at the time of listing, in order to collect these fees. When the item sells on eBay.de, eBay will calculate your payout amount by converting the sales proceeds from EUR to USD using the transaction exchange rate applicable at the time of the sale. If eBay converts your funds, the conversion will be completed at the transaction exchange rate we set for the relevant currency exchange. eBay's transaction exchange rate is composed of a base exchange rate plus a conversion charge. The conversion charge is a fixed percentage applied to the base exchange rate and retained by eBay. The base exchange rate reflects rates within the wholesale currency markets applicable to the currency pairing on the day of the conversion, or the prior business day. If exchange rates are set by law or regulation, the base exchange rate reflects the government reference rates. If your registered address is in the US, the seller currency conversion charge applied and retained by eBay is 3%. If your registered address is not in the US, please refer to the fee page for your country or region of residence for your seller currency conversion charge information. Examples of fee calculations Auction-style listing example You're selling the latest version of a smartphone in used condition using a 10-day duration. You select a starting price of $199, with a Buy It Now price of $400, and you offer free shipping. You've already used your allocation of zero insertion fee listings this month. You are meeting our performance expectations. The item sells immediately for the Buy It Now price of $400. Since you aren't charging the buyer for shipping or any other costs, $424 is the total amount of the sale (includes 6% sales tax). Your total fees for this item: Insertion fee $0.35 Final value fee (12.9% of $424, + $0.30) $55.00 Total fees $55.35 You make $344.65, or approximately 86% of the sale price, not including shipping costs. Fixed price listing example You're selling a trading card for $9,500 with free shipping. You've already used your allocation of zero insertion fee listings this month, and your seller account is meeting our performance expectations at the time your item sells. To attract the attention of more buyers, you add the Bold listing upgrade. The total amount of the sale is $10,070 (includes 6% sales tax). Your total fees for this item: Insertion fee $0.35 Final value fee (12.9% of $7,500, + 2.35% of $2,570, + $0.30) $1,028.20 Bold fee $6.00 Total fees $1,034.55 You make $8,465.46, or approximately 89% of the sale price, not including shipping costs.
