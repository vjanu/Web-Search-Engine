Millions of buyers already shop for jewelry on eBay and new investments in the category will deliver better experiences and improved conversion. Starting July 20, 2022, Authenticity Guarantee, our authentication service for luxury items, will begin to cover inventory from eBay sellers who list items that sell for $500 or more in the Fine Jewelry and Engagement and Wedding Jewelry categories. We will be increasing our coverage of listings throughout the summer and fall and we’ll notify you when Authenticity Guarantee applies to your inventory. Along with the extension of Authenticity Guarantee to jewelry, we’ll also be investing in marketing to drive traffic and new buyers, and improvements to the jewelry buying experience on our platform. To help fulfill our commitment to the jewelry category, we will update final value fees* effective September 12, 2022. *Final value fee changes referenced above apply to the Jewelry & Watches category, and not Watches, Parts & Accessories at this time.
